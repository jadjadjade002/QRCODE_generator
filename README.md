# QRCode_generator.py
This QR Code generator program was created because I noticed that when designing posters for advertisements, whether for educational purposes, event promotions, recruitment, or other activities, it is often necessary to include a QR Code. Many times, scanning the QR Code directs users to a specific website. Therefore, I developed this program with functionalities such as adding a logo to the QR Code and saving the QR Code.
